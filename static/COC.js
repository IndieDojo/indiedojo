## The Quick Version

Our course is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of course participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any course venue, including lectures, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Course participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the course without a refund at the discretion of the course organiser.

## The Less Quick Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of lectures or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the course organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the course with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the organiser or one of the trainers immediately.

Organisers will be happy to help participants contact a local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the course. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at course and workshop venues and course-related social events.
