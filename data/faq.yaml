- q: What's included in the price?
  a: >
    By booking a camp, you get:

    - **6 full days** of classes led by two experienced instructors who have successfully deployed their own project

    - **6 nights** shared accommodation in Kyoto in a traditional Japanese house

    - Exclusive access to an **online chatroom** for Indie Dojo members


- q: Can you really learn how to build and launch your product  in such a short time?
  a: >
    While becoming a designer or developer takes years, that doesn't mean you can't learn valuable skills in just a few days.


    Even understanding what skills you need and how to acquire them is hugely beneficial. And if you have any specific areas you're interested in, our instructors will be happy to answer your questions and point you in the right direction.

- q: Who is this for?
  a: >
    This bootcamp is for you if:

    - You have a product idea but don't know where to start

    - You have a product but not enough traction and want to boost growth

    - You want to meet other determined indie founders

    - You've been procrastinating forever and want to just start building


- q: Why Japan? Why Kyoto?
  a: >
    Many people dream of going to Japan but it's not always easy to find a chance to go. So we thought that we'd give you a reason to pack your bags and finally visit this beautiful country!



    Kyoto, one of the best-preserved cities in Japan,  is very walkable, and convenient to access from Osaka’s Kansai International Airport. And what's more, there's no better place to enjoy Japan's famous multi-colored autumn leaves , or *kōyo*.

- q: Will I learn to code?
  a: >
    No. This is not a coding bootcamp, and a single week would not be enough time to learn to code. You can still gain valuable insights from the camp even if you don't know how to code though, and we will be able to point you in the right direction if you do want to learn.

- q: Do I need to already have a product?
  a: >
    While having an existing product is not required, you'll get more out of the camp if you're already working on a specific project or at least have an idea you want to develop.

- q: What will a typical day be like?
  a: >
    We'll all meet at 9:30 and start class. We'll cover 2-3 topics in the morning, break for lunch, then cover one or two topics in the the afternoon.


    Then, from 3pm on you'll spend the rest of the day to putting into practice what you've learned. Instructors will assist you if you get stuck and will help you to move forward with your project.

- q: What's your refund policy?
  a: >
    If you cannot attend, you may receive a full refund if you request before TWO months prior to the event. You are entitled to 50% of the fee if you request ONE month before the event.


    If you request a refund within one month of the event, we won't be able to refund you (although you're welcome to sell your spot to somebody else).
