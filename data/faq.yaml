- q: What's included in the price?
  a: >
    By booking a camp, you get: 

    - **6 days** of classes lead by two experienced instructors. 

    - **6 nights** shared accomodation in Kyoto in a traditional Japanese house.

    - Access to an exclusive **online chatroom** for Indie Dojo members.

    - Over **$500** worth of perks from Indie Dojo partners.

- q: Can you really learn anything in such a short time?
  a: >
    While becoming an actual designer or developer takes years, that doesn't mean you can't learn valuable skills in just a few days, or even a few hours. 


    Even just understanding what skills you're lacking and what path to take to acquire them can be hugely beneficial. And if you have any specific areas you're interested in, our instructors will be happy to answer your questions as best as they can. 

- q: Who is this for?
  a: >
    This bootcamp is for you if:
    
    - You have a product idea, but don't know where to start.
    
    - You have a product, but feel stuck and want to boost growth.

    - You want to meet other determined indie founders.

    - You've been procrastinating forever, and want to just start building.
    

- q: Why Japan? Why Kyoto?
  a: >
    Many people dream of going to Japan, but it's not always easy to find a chance to go. So we thought that we'd give you a reason to pack your bags and finally visit this beautiful country!


    As for Kyoto, it's one of the best-preserved cities in Japan, is very walkable, and convenient to access from Kansai International Airport. And what's more, there's no better place to enjoy Japan's famous multi-colored autumn leaves , or *kōyo*.

- q: Will I learn to code?
  a: >
    No. This is not a coding bootcamp, and a single week would not be enough time to learn to code. You can still gain valuable insights from the camp even if you don't know how to code though, and we might be able to point you in the right direction if you do want to learn.

- q: Do I need to already have a product?
  a: >
    While having an existing product is not required, you'll get more out of the camp if you're already working on a specific project, or at least have an idea you want to develop. 

- q: What will a typical day be like?
  a: >
    We'll all meet at 9:30 and then start with the lesson's classes. We'll cover 2-3 topics in the morning, break for lunch, then cover one or two more things in the first part of the afternoon. 

    Then, from 3pm on you'll have the rest of the day to put in practice what you've learned, ask instructors for help, or even explore the city.  

- q: What's your refund policy?
  a: >
    If you can't make it for whatever reason, we'll give you a full refund up until two months before the start of the camp. We'll refund 50% of the fee up until one month before the start. 


    After this, we won't be able to refund you (although you're welcome to sell your spot to somebody else).
